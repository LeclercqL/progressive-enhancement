            <h2>The story</h2>
            Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away.
            That evening, all of his neighbors came around to commiserate.
            They said,<div class="villagers"> “We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away. This is
                mostunfortunate.”</div>
            The farmer said,<div class="farmer">“Maybe.”</div>
            The next day the horse came back bringing seven wild horses with it, and in the evening severybody
            came back and said,<div class="villagers">“Oh, isn’t that lucky. What a great turn of events. You
                now have eight horses!”</div>
            The farmer again said, <div class="farmer">“Maybe.”</div>
            <wbr>
            The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while riding it, he was thrown and broke
            his leg.The neighbors then said,<div class="villagers">“Oh dear, that’s too bad,”</div>
            and the farmer responded,<div class="farmer">“Maybe.”</div>
            The next day the conscription officers came around to conscript people into the army, and they rejected his
            son because
            he had a broken leg. Again all the neighbors came around and said, <div class="villagers">“Isn’t that
                great!”</div> Again, he said,<div class="farmer">“Maybe.”</div>
            <blockquote>
                The whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense complexity, and it’s really
                impossible to
                tell
                whether anything that happens in it is good or bad — because you never know what will be the consequence
                of
                the
                misfortune; or, you never know what will be the consequences of good fortune.

            <p>
                Good and Bad are just one perspective. Bananas are good for monkeys, but monkeys are not good for
                bananas.
                Let's not make a big deal out of it...
